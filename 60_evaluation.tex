\section{Experimental Evaluation}

{\color{red} Fragment 3:} In order to evaluate our architecture, we use the LDC dataset {\color{red}[TODO: which?]}, in which each query $q$ is described as a set of hypotheses with its support set. Therefore, {\color{red} we must define a similarity score between support sets for each hypothesis in order to evaluate the compliance of our KB with respect to the returned hypotheses.}
